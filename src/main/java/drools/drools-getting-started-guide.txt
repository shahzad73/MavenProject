Drools 


Include the maven repositories 

create some drools java  files    initially i created HelloDools  with 2 objects    Golfer and DroolsIntro




Now create a folder     drools     under   /src/main/resources     and put all .drl files in there. 
remember that drools is now the package  that will be referenced within kmodule.xml file 
Also all rules under this folder should have    "package drools;"      on top to put those rules under this package




Now create file  kmodule.xml  in META-INF   folder in   src/main/resources        here are the contents of this file
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kmodule xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xmlns="http://www.drools.org/xsd/kmodule">

    <kbase name="HelloDrools" packages="drools">
        <ksession name="HelloDroolsSession"/>
    </kbase>

</kmodule>

Note following in above xml file
1.  create kbase and note the packages     packages should refer packages that contain rules
2.  ksession     note the name in this case   HelloDroolsSession       this name will be used in drool java program 
    to create an instance.    All rules mentioned in packages will be available under this session.  check HelloDrools.java  file and see how this instance is created





To compile  this program and these make sure that you have the      build       section in pom      i have a copy of that in the OneNote Java/Maven page
put that section at end of the pom              that build  section creates the uber jar with all dependencies
