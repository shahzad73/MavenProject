we will see Hadoop map side join with Distributed Cache below

first of all we need to prepare data samples for this map side join

Note: we need to remember one thing is that we always put the small file in the distributed cache and 
send large file to map phase.


Note this is also example of map side join as smaller file has been distrobuted to all mappers 
and then in map there is a join


Table 1 (Always Small Table):

Department table with deptno and deptname(tab seperated)        hdfs file name   "departments_txt"
001	hadoop
002	hive
003	pig
004	sqoop
005	oozie
006	mapreduce

Table 2(Always LargeTable):

Employee table with Employee info(tab separated)				hdfs file name    "empdata_txt"

empid    empname    salary    deptid

1	name	2000	001
2	name2	4000	002
3	name3	5000	005
4	name4	7000	003
5	name5	8000	004



Desired Output
empid    empname    salary    deptid	deptName

1    name    2000    001    hadoop
2    name2    4000    002    hive
3    name3    5000    005    oozie
4    name4    7000    003    pig
5    name5    8000    004    sqoop







hadoop jar mjar22.jar hadoop.DistributedCache.MapJoinDriver /tmp/empdata_txt /tmp/res1
